- Research Intern at **University of Sydney**
- Topic **Cybersecurity (Superoptimization of Grammar Based Fuzzers)**
- Professor **Rahul Gopinath**

### Experience

My experience was kind of a mixed bag. Sydney is absolutely amazing and beautiful, and I could go on all day about how great everything was
(except the outrageous pricing of everything, thankfully most of my expenses were covered).
Public transport there is perfect and you can literally go to any corner of the
city with the extensive network of buses, trams, trains and ferries.
To be honest, I wanted to have experience living alone and touring a foreign country
and it could not have been better, apart from the week I spent in bed due to typhoid :/


Coming to the actual internship, the work I was given was not very interesting to say the least.
The aim was to apply superoptimization techniques to grammar based fuzzers.
I will not go in much details of the specifics of it (you can ask for the papers if you are interested), but
in short I was asked to try superoptimization techniques on python bytecode assembly as a proof of concept that superoptimization
can lead to an improvement in grammar fuzzers. I went through a few papers and did whatever I could to achieve the task but
the professor was very busy with the semester and could not give me much time. There were also no PhD students working in that specific
area who could help me. At the end of the internship, we presented our work to Prof Sorav Bansal who is a part of the CS Department at
IITD and an expert in superoptimization, only for him to say that the work assigned to me by the prof was not something where
anything concrete could be achieved, so whatever time I had spent was not of much use. This is not uncommon in research, but
disheartening nonetheless.

### How did you get your intern ?
- [CS Rankings](csrankings.org) : Helped me find universities ranked above IITD. The list of profs here is mostly those with
high number of publications so it is unlikely that they would take you given you are only in 2nd year.
- **QS Rankings** : Also helped me find universities ranked above IITD.
- **Individual university websites** : After finding out the universities ranked above IITD, I looked through the faculty pages of those universities
 and noted the contact information of professors working in areas I was interested in. Try not to email very senior profs.
- [BSW Cover letters](https://bsw.iitd.ac.in/Placement_Talks-master/homepage/foreign_intern/foreign_intern.html) : Helped me write my cover lette

### Tips

- Start applying on time. I can't emphasize this enough. I missed out on a lot of great University programs
 because they have their deadlines around October whereas I only started applying in December.
- Cold mail a lot of professors. I emailed over 150 and online got 1 positive response for a paid offline intern
 and 5-6 for remote opportunities.
- Customize the emails a little based on the professor's area and research but do not spend much time on this because most likely
 you will not receive a reply.
- Cold mailing is a very luck based process so you'll have to keep trying because you won't
 even get a reply for 9 out of 10 of your mails, but it does usually work.
- Do not compromise your 3rd year intern prep. I am a dual degree student so this did not affect me much, but I have seen others
 who could not prepare well.
