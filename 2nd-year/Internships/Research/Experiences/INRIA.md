- Intern at **INRIA - Centre University Cote D'Azur**
- Topic: **Graph Algorithms, Phylogeny, Bioinformatics**
- Professor: **Dr. Edoardo SARTI, Team  ABS (Algorithms Biology Structure)**
### Experience

The research experience was great. My advisor actually gave a real problem and not like just implementing some peudo-code given in some paper. The project was on live phylogeny. Given pairwise distances between a set of genome sequences, one needs to develop a novel heuristic to construct an evolutionary tree. The existing methods which work well only contructs a phylogeny tree with no parent-child like relationship but a tree where all the datapoints occupy the leaves and internal nodes are empty. For more details, please feel free to contact.   The place where we lived (along the French Riviera) was nice. Beautiful beaches and adjacent to beach, are the hills. We were staying in the "tech park" - Sophia Antipolis. It is like a semi-urban town. But very good places nearby if you like nature i.e. beaches/swimming/hikes/mountains. Cannes is 10 km away (can go to see the red carpet). Monaco grand prix (Monaco is 35 mins by train). Also cheap flights/buses to Rome (Italy is very near).  

### Resources

A senior recommended to one of my friend. And he recommended me to apply. I also had an invitation from the INRIA Team GenScale at Rennes but I chose this because of good project description and location.

### Tips

1. Initially, I would recommend to send personalised emails to professors. Please read about their research work and mention something about one of the papers he has published (even if you just read the abstract). This shows your interest and professors like this unlike the general spam emails that many people write.
2. Please don't sacrifice your 3rd year intern preparation because of the summer internship. Prepare well for the next year intern during or before the research internship since the working hours are not very high (in our case it was around 7-8 hrs every working day).

### Resources

I applied in multiple programs and labs, by looking at the list of programs. I emailed researchers in those labs by looking at their fields and research interests if they were mine too.

### Tips

I would advise them to try to maintain their grades and academic performance since at the end of their 3rd sem, professors can only look at their coursework or grades. Try to search for research projects aligning with your interest and connect what you have learnt so far with what they demand in your cover letter.

- Research Intern at **Inria, France**
- Topic **Computational Biology/Bioinformatics**


### Experience
The experience at Inria was extremely enriching - my team was very friendly and welcoming - and I enjoyed having intellectually stimulating discussions with them. I got to work in the ABS team: Algorithms, Biology, Structure. My work was initially mathematical, trying to prove a hypothesis proposed by my advisor which would speed up an algorithm they were implementing. In the latter half, I was responsible for implementing the algorithm using SageMath (Python) and also graphing using Maple. Inria provided me with a holistic idea of what research is all about, and helped me realize that it is what I am passionate about. Since I had no prior experience in bioinformatics, it was a slightly steep learning curve, but the fun was in the challenge. 

### How did you get your intern ?
A senior who had interned there in the previous year told me about the opportunity. 

### Tips
- I have seen both ends of the spectrum - people getting clarity about doing research via completing a research intern, and people regretting just doing a research intern 'for the sake of it' and not getting enough time to prepare for their OCS tests and interviews. 

- I would say though, it is worth doing a research intern if you have even the slightest inclination towards research. 

- Doing research under a professor at IIT Delhi is also a good option if you are not sure about your interests. If you are a fence-sitter, it will give you exposure to what research is about, and will also give you enough time for your 3rd year internship preparation.
